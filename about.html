<h2>About</h2>

<p>
:art:&nbsp; I am Sebastian Rodriguez Colina (srcolinas), a Sofware Developer who enjoys working in highly productive teams,
which for me means teams that can build, test and release their sofware updates quickly.
</p>

<p>
I am still not sure about the shape this personal place will take, I will be sharing, among other things:
<ol>
    <li>How I build real software: sharing what I consider to be best practices and how they apply to different situations.</li>
    <li>Experiments I would do on certain technologies or approaches to software.</li>
    <li>Geneal thoughts I guess.</li>
</ol>

My views will be entirely open to debate, please feel free to open PRs or issues in
<a href="https://github.com/srcolinas/srcolinas.github.io" github repo that holds></a> this space.
If you like the content you see, please share with others and maybe let me know on LinkedIn or github itself.
</p>
