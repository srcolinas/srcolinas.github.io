I am Sebastian Rodriguez Colina (srcolinas), a Sofware Enginer who enjoys working in highly productive teams,
which for me means teams that can build, test and release their sofware updates quickly.

I am still not sure about the shape this personal place will take, I will be sharing, among other things:

* How I build real software: sharing what I consider to be best practices and how they apply to different situations.
* Experiments I would do on certain technologies or approaches to software.


My views will be entirely open to debate, please feel free to open PRs or issues in [the github repo in which I save this space](https://github.com/srcolinas/srcolinas.github.io).
If you like the content you see, please share with others and maybe let me know on LinkedIn or github itself.
